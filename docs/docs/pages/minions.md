# Minions

(screenshot of minions view)

List all minions currently in Alcali database.

To add more minions, use the _fab_ button and refresh all minions. Only currently accepted keys will be added.

!!! info
    
    By default, refreshing minions will only run `grains.items` on all minions.
    
    If you add [custom minions fields](settings.md), they will be run too.


To access [minion details](minion_details.md), click on the minion id.
